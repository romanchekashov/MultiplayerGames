# CounterHandler implements a really simple protocol:
#   - For every incoming bidirectional stream, it counts bytes it receives on
#     that stream until the stream is closed, and then replies with that byte
#     count on the same stream.
#   - For every incoming unidirectional stream, it counts bytes it receives on
#     that stream until the stream is closed, and then replies with that byte
#     count on a new unidirectional stream.
#   - For every incoming datagram, it sends a datagram with the length of
#     datagram that was just received.
